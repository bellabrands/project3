      <h2>Fundementals: </h2>
      <p>Rules:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Each player is allowed one reserve per serve if no one wins a point. This would  be if the point was out.<li>
        <li>When serving you must go to one side of the court and stand behind the line then, hit it into the square on the diagnol.<li>
        <li>A player must hit a shot either before the ball has bounced or after the first bounce.</li>
        <li> If the ball bounces twice, then the player with the last shot wins the point.</li>
        <li>A player must also wait for the ball to pass the net and come over to his side of the court and cannot step over the net to hit the ball.</li>
        <li>The ball is considered if it bounces between the lines or on the lines. When playing singles, you usually do not use the alleys but when you are playing doubles, meaning that you have a partner, you do use the alleys.</li>
      </ul>
      
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <p>How the game works:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>1st, you must figure out who is going to serve first using the coin flip technique, to do this you and the other player pick up or down then spin the racket to see which side it lands on.</li>
      <li>Then, The first person will serve.</li>
      <li>After each point the server will switch sizes and change the score once they reach 60 points.</li>
      <li>Then, the next player will serve. however, the players will not change sides or the score this time. As you only do that on odd games. So, 1,3,and 5.</li>
      <li>Once the game is over, shake hands with your opponent and be a good sport.</li>
    </ul>
